  "position_check_description": "<block>Labware Position Check is a guided workflow that checks every labware on the deck for an added degree of precision in your protocol.</block><block>When you check a labware, the OT-2’s pipette nozzle or attached tip will stop at the center of the A1 well. If the pipette nozzle or tip is not centered, you can reveal the OT-2’s jog controls to make an adjustment. This Labware Offset will be applied to the entire labware. Offset data is measured to the nearest 1/10th mm and can be made in the X, Y and/or Z directions.</block>",
