# Internal Release 1.0.0

This is 1.0.0, an internal release for the app supporting the Opentrons Flex.

This is still pretty early in the process, so some things are known not to work, and are listed below. Some things that may surprise you do work, and are also listed below. There may also be some littler things of note, and those are at the bottom.


## New Stuff In This Release
- Support for running labware position check using the calibration adapter for added accuracy (note: not an automated flow, just uses the adapter instead of a tip)
- Support for 96-channel pipettes in protocols
- Early provisional support for deck configuration and trash chutes in protocols
